        "In this module, we will examine an application of agent-based simulations in the context of a transportation system and analyze how traffic jams are formed.\n",

        "Agent-based simulations allow testing different changes to the agents, scenarios, and conditions of a system. In the case of transportation systems, it is possible to study changes to the roads, drivers, traffic laws, and roadblocks, for example. Depending on the objective of a study, these changes can then be quantified in terms of CO2 emissions, transportation time, number of accidents, maximum number of vehicles, average speed, etc.\n",

        "## Interaction\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many applications of agent-based simulations. Some of these include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simulate the spread of infectious diseases\n",
        "- Simulate economic systems\n",
        "- Simulate transportation systems\n",
        "- Simulate pedestrian movement\n",
        "- Simulate the evolution of urban areas\n",
        "- Simulate patient flow in hospitals and healthcare resource allocation\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a model requires deciding what to include or not based on its purpose. Including too many details about the system and its elements can make the modelling challenging. On the other side, missing important aspects can lead to not being able to capture the phenomena we want to study. Suppose we want to model a transportation system; one must decide if it is necessary to consider the drivers' emotions and how it affects their driving, or we can assume all drivers will behave in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we must define the appropriate resolution level or abstraction we should use as the reference point for our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this interaction, we will use an agent-based simulation to study traffic jams. The objective of the simulation is to understand how the number of vehicles and acceleration decisions can lead to traffic jams. For this objective, we will create an environment where our agents, representing vehicles and drivers, move.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code of this simulation is based on the work of Allen Downey, as it appears in the book Think Complexity, 2nd edition (https://thinkcomplex.com) and published under the MIT License (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous modules, our agents occupied single discrete squares in 1D spaces (arrays) or 2D spaces (matrices, checkboards), but we can arrange our agents in other structures like networks, continuous spaces, etc. For this simulation, we will change the environment format. We will assume a continuous one-dimensional circular space that represents a single-line road with no space for passing, named Highway in the code below, with `n` number of drivers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class Driver defines the operation of the agents, represented by blue squares in the simulation. Agents have a single decision to make during the simulation: choose the acceleration of their vehicles. Their default behaviour is to accelerate to the maximum (1 mile/hr), until they get blocked by the car immediately ahead. When this occurs, drivers have to break to avoid a collision. The speed of the vehicle will be set to 0, the simulation will show a triangle, and it will be registered as a crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the simulation, random noise will affect the vehicle speed. This noise represents the imperfection in the conditions (slippery roads, distracted drivers, mechanical problems, etc.).\n",
        "   \n",
        "### Assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions are basic conditions or premises that are considered to be true for the purpose of the model or conducting an analysis. They simplify the conditions of the real-world system to make it more manageable for study.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, these are some of the assumptions made in this traffic model:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Single-line road.\n",
        "- Vehicles can't be passed.\n",
        "- Vehicles can only go forward.\n",
        "- Vehicles are initially positioned equally spaced across the road.\n",
        "- Vehicles have an initial speed of 4 miles/hr (6.437 km/hr).\n",
        "- Vehicles have a maximum speed of 40 miles/hr (64.37 km/hr).\n",
        "- The maximum acceleration is 1 mile/hr and the minimum is -10 miles/hr.\n",
        "- Random noise can be added to represent different driving conditions.\n",
        "- Collisions (indicated with a triangle during the simulation) cause vehicles to stop (speed = 0).\n",
        "- The number of vehicles is kept constant during the simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simulate different scenarios assuming various numbers of vehicles and driving conditions (random noise):\n",
        "    - Scenario 1: Low number of vehicles (<=10 vehicles) and no random noise (`eps` = 0). An `eps` value of 0 represents perfect driving conditions or no random noise.\n",
        "    - Scenario 2: Low number of vehicles (<=10 vehicles) and low random noise (`eps` = 0.01).\n",
        "    - Scenario 3: Intermediate number of vehicles (>10 and <=25 vehicles) and high random noise (`eps` = 0.1)."
